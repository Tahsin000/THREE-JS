• What is Three js?
    • Three.js is an application programming interface (API) and cross-browser JavaScript library that is used to produce and show animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
__________

• Why do you need three js?
    • Three. Js makes advantage of WebGL, a JavaScript API that allows for the plugin-free rendering of interactive 3D and 2D graphics in web browsers. Three. js, a cross-browser framework, uses WebGL to display fluid 3D motion in your browser, giving multi-dimensional objects tremendous web-wide power.

• How does Three js work?
    • ThreeJS is a Javascript library developed by Mr. doob that enables you to work with 3D objects right in the browser. What you need to know is that ThreeJS enables WebGL on an HTML5 canvas using Javascript.

A Javascript API called WebGL enables the creation of 2D and 3D graphic rendering. A canvas is an HTML element that may display graphic rendering and is included in the HTML5 specification.

Through Javascript, ThreeJS enables you to control WebGL and subsequently 3D. And the most absurd aspect is that no further plugins or installations are required! The moment the library is imported, the 3D environment appears.

So in summary, we have a Javascript library(ThreeJS) that manipulates a Javascript API to do graphical rendering (WebGL) in an HTML5 component. Easy!
